# Problem

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

>>Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
 
Constraints:

- board.length == 9
- board[i].length == 9
- board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) 
    {
        // Constant because of 3*3 matrix
        const int num = 9;

        // Create a boolean array to keep track of digits
        bool row[num][num] = {false};
        bool column[num][num] = {false};
        bool subGrid[num][num] = {false};

        // Go through every cell
        for (int r = 0; r < num; r++)
        {
            for (int c = 0; c < num; c++)
            {
                // Skip over the dots
                if (board[r][c] == '.')
                {
                    continue;
                }

                // Get an integer value from the strings
                int index = board[r][c] - '0' - 1;

                // Get the subGrid position
                int gridNum = (r/3) * 3 + (c/3);

                // Check if the boolean array already has a number set to true
                if (row[r][index] || column[c][index] || subGrid[gridNum][index])
                {
                    return false;
                }

                // Set the number whin the boolean array to true
                row[r][index] = true;
                column[c][index] = true;
                subGrid[gridNum][index] = true;
            }
        }

        return true;
