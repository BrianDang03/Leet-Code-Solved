# Problem

Given a string s of lower and upper case English letters.

A good string is a string which doesn't have two adjacent characters s[i] and s[i + 1] where:

- 0 <= i <= s.length - 2
- s[i] is a lower-case letter and s[i + 1] is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa.

To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.

Return the string after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints.

Notice that an empty string is also good.

>Example 1:
>
>>Input: s = "leEeetcode"
>>
>>Output: "leetcode"
>>
>>Explanation: In the first step, either you choose i = 1 or i = 2, both will result "leEeetcode" to be reduced to "leetcode".

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: s = "abBAcC"
>>
>>Output: ""
>>
>>Explanation: We have many possible scenarios, and all lead to the same answer. For example:
>>
>>"abBAcC" --> "aAcC" --> "cC" --> ""
>>
>>"abBAcC" --> "abBA" --> "aA" --> ""

>Example 3:
>
>>Input: s = "s"
>>
>>Output: "s"
 
Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 100
- s contains only lower and upper case English letters.

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    string makeGood(string s) 
    {
        // Assume that the String is not Good
        bool isGood = false;

        // While it is not good
        while (!isGood)
        {
            // Each iteration, try to create a good
            isGood = true;
            string temp = "";

            // Go through the bad string and only take good charaters
            for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)
            {
                // If aA or Aa, string is not good and skip two charaters
                if ((s[i + 1] - 32 == s[i]) || (s[i + 1] == s[i] - 32))
                {   
                    isGood = false;
                    i += 2;
                }

                // If a good charaters and is a alphabet, add to temp string
                if (isalpha(s[i]))
                {
                    temp += s[i];
                }
            }

            // Set the maybe good string 
            s = temp;
        }    

        //Return the good string
        return s;
    }
};
```
