# Problem

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Note:

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.
 
>Example 1:
>
>>Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
>>
>>Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
>>
>>Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
>>
>>Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
>>
>>Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.

Constraints:

- The input must be a binary string of length 32
 
Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) 
    {
        // Create a stroage for the answer                  
        uint32_t ans = 0;
        // Maximum number of bits in a 32 bit  
        int maxBits = 32;

        // Go through the bits     
        while (maxBits--)
        {
            // Shift left 1 on ans 
            ans <<= 1;
            // Get the right most bit of n
            ans |= (n & 1);
            // Shift right 1 on n;
            n >>= 1;         
        } 
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
