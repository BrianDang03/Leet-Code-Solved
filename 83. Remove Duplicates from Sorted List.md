Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) 
    {
        //If there are no head nodes
        if (!head)
        {
            //Return
            return head;
        }

        //Create a dummy node to traverse, head node remains the same
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode();
        dummy = head;

        //Keey iterating when there are elements in the list
        while (dummy->next != nullptr)
        {
            //If the current val is equal to the next val
            if (dummy->val == dummy->next->val)
            {
                //Set the next node to the node after the next node
                dummy->next = dummy->next->next;
            }
            else
            {
                //Traverse through the list
                dummy = dummy->next;
            }
        }

        //Clean up pointer
        dummy = dummy->next;
        delete dummy;

        //Return head
        return head;
    }
