# Problem

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

>>
>>Output: false
>>
>>Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:

>>
>>(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
>>
>>There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

>Example 3:
>
>>
>>Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
>>
>>Output: false
>>
>>Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
 
Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
- -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check if there exists a path from root to leaf
    // with the given sum
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        // If the root is null, there is no path, so return false
        if (!root) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // If the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children),
        // check if its value equals the remaining target sum.
        if (!root->left && !root->right) {
            return targetSum == root->val;
        }
        
        // Recursively check if there exists a path with the remaining
        // target sum on the left and right subtrees
        bool left_sum = hasPathSum(root->left, targetSum - root->val);
        bool right_sum = hasPathSum(root->right, targetSum - root->val);
        
        // Return true if either the left or right subtree contains a path
        // with the remaining target sum
        return left_sum || right_sum;
    }
};

```
