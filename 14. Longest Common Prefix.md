# Problem

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
 
>Example 1:
>
>>Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
>>
>>Output: "fl"

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
>>
>>Output: ""
>>
>>Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

- 1 <= strs.length <= 200

- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200

- strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) 
    {
       //Empty String
       string ans = "";

       //Sort the Array of Strings
       sort(strs.begin(), strs.end());

       //Set the First and Last strings of the Sorted Array
       string firstStr = strs[0], lastStr = strs[strs.size() - 1];

       //Compare every letter of the first and last strings
       for (int i = 0; i < min(firstStr.size(), lastStr.size()); i++)
       {
            //If Letters are Different, break 
            if (firstStr[i] != lastStr[i])
            {
                break; 
            }

            //Append letters that are the same to the Empty String  
            ans += firstStr[i];
       }

       return ans; 
    }
};
```
