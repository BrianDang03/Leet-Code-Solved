# Problem

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

>Example 1:
>
>>Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
>>
>>Output: 2

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
>>
>>Output: 1

>Example 3:
>
>>Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
>>
>>Output: 4
 
Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>4</sup>

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) 
    {
        int high = nums.size() - 1;
        int low = 0;
        int mid;

        // Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other
        while (low <= high) 
        {
            //Get the Middle For Each Loop
            mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            //Spliting the Array in Half Each time
            if (nums[mid] == target)
                return mid;
            if (nums[mid] < target)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        
        //Determines the place index of target if non.
        return nums[mid] > target ? mid : mid + 1;
    }
};
```
