# Problem

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of 
set bits
 it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
 
>Example 1:
>
>>Input: n = 11
>>
>>Output: 3
>>
>>Explanation:
>>
>>The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: n = 128
>>
>>Output: 1
>>
>>Explanation:
>>
>>The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

>Example 3:
>
>>Input: n = 2147483645
>>
>>Output: 30
>>
>>Explanation:
>>
>>The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(int n) 
    {
        // Convert the number in to a bitwise number 
        bitset<32> b(n);

        // Storage for the answer
        int ans = 0;

        // Go through the 32 bit number 
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++)
        {
            // Shift to the right and & it to get the number   
            if ((n >> i) & 1)
            {
                ans++;
            }
        }

        // Return answer 
        return ans;
    }
};
```
