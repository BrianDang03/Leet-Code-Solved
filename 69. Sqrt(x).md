# Problem

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.
 
>Example 1:
>
>>Input: x = 4
>>
>>Output: 2
>>
>>Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: x = 8
>>
>>Output: 2
>>
>>Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 
Constraints:

- 0 <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) 
    {
        int l = 0;
        int r = x;
        int ans = 0;

        while (l <= r)
        {
            //Always take the middle
            long m = (l + r)/2;

            if (m * m > x)
            {
                //Move right pointer to the left, closer to the number
                r = m - 1;
            }
            else
            {
                //Answer will always be the pushed towards the middle
                ans = m;
                //Move left pointer to the right, closer to the number
                l = m + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
