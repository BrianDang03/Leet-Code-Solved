Table: Person

>+-------------+---------+
>| personId    | int     |
>| lastName    | varchar |

Table: Address

>```
>+-------------+---------+
>| Column Name | Type    |
>+-------------+---------+
>| addressId   | int     |
>| personId    | int     |
>| city        | varchar |
>| state       | varchar |

>addressId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
>Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
 

Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

>Example 1:
>
>>Input: 
>>
>>Person table:
>>```
>>+----------+----------+-----------+
>>| personId | lastName | firstName |
>>+----------+----------+-----------+
>>| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
>>| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
>>+----------+----------+-----------+
>>```
>>
>>Address table:
>>
>>```
>>+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
>>| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
>>+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
>>| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
>>| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
>>+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
>>```
>>
>>Output:
>>
>>```
>>+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
>>| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
>>+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
>>| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
>>| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
>>+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
>>```

Explanation: 
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.

# Solution

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
-- Selecting specific columns from the Person and Address tables
SELECT firstName, lastName, city, state
-- From the Person table, aliased as 'p'
FROM Person p
-- Performing a LEFT JOIN with the Address table, aliased as 'a'
-- This ensures that all rows from the 'Person' table are returned,
-- along with any matching rows from the 'Address' table
LEFT JOIN Address a
-- Specifying the condition for the JOIN operation
-- Joining rows where the personId in the 'Person' table matches the personId in the 'Address' table
ON p.personId = a.personId
```
