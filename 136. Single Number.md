# Problem

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

>Example 1:
>
>>Input: nums = [2,2,1]
>>
>>Output: 1

>Example 2:
>
>Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
>>Output: 4

>Example 3:
>
>>Input: nums = [1]
>>Output: 1
 
Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

# Solution

```
// Define a class named Solution
class Solution {
public:
    // Define a function named singleNumber that takes a vector of integers as input and returns an integer
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        // Initialize a variable named ans to store the result
        int ans = 0;
        
        // Iterate through each element of the vector
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
        {
            // Use XOR (^) operation to toggle the bits of ans with the current element of nums
            ans ^= nums[i];
        }     

        // Return the final result
        return ans;
    }
};

```
