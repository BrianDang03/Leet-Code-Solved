# Problem

Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

>Example 1:
>
>>Input: rowIndex = 3
>>
>>Output: [1,3,3,1]

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: rowIndex = 0
>>
>>Output: [1]

>Example 3:
>
>>Input: rowIndex = 1
>>
>>Output: [1,1]
 
Constraints:

- 0 <= rowIndex <= 33
 
Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra space?

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getRow(int rowIndex) 
    {
        //Create the start of Pacal's
        vector<int> v = {1};

        //Create Rows             
        for (int i = 0; i < rowIndex; i++)
        {
            //Create a new Row
            vector<int> tmp;
            //First Index
            tmp.push_back(1);
            
            //Go through the previous row and add numbers to the new row
            for (int j = 1; j < v.size(); j++)
            {
                tmp.push_back(v[j - 1] + v[j]);
            }

            //Last Index
            tmp.push_back(1);
            v = tmp;
        }     

        //Retrun the Row
        return v;
    }
};
```
