# Problem

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

>Example 1:
>
>>Input: s = "Hello World"
>>
>>Output: 5
>>
>>Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
>>
>>Output: 4
>>
>>Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

>Example 3:
>
>>Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
>>
>>Output: 6
>>
>>Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 
Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
- There will be at least one word in s.

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) 
    {
        //Flag turns true when encounters a charater
        bool flag = false;

        //Counter for Length of Word 
        int len = 0;

        //Go through the list backwards
        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            //If there is a space and flag was triggered
            if (s[i] == ' ' && flag) break;

            //If encountered the first charater, trigger flag and inc len
            if (s[i] != ' ')
            {
                flag = true;
                len++;
            }
        }    

        //Return Length of Last Word
        return len;
    }
};
```
