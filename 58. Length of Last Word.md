Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) 
    {
        bool flag = false;
        int len = 0;
        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            if (s[i] == ' ' && flag) break;
            if (s[i] != ' ')
            {
                flag = true;
                len++;
            }
        }    

        return len;
    }
};
