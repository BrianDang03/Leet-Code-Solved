# Problem

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

>Example 1:
>
>>Input: n = 2
>>
>>Output: 2
>>
>>Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
>>
>>1. 1 step + 1 step
>>
>>2. 2 steps

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: n = 3
>>
>>Output: 3
>>
>>Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
>>
>>1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
>>
>>2. 1 step + 2 steps
>>
>>3. 2 steps + 1 step
 
Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 45

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) 
    {
        //Fibonacci Sequence
        //Prevous Number
        int pre = 0;
        //Next Number
        int next = 1;
        //Result of the previous and next number
        int ans = next + pre;
        //Steps till the nth steps
        int steps = 0;

        //While steps is less than the nth
        while (steps < n)
        {
            //Get the answer
            ans = next + pre;
            //Set the previous number 
            pre = next;
            //Set the next number
            next = ans;
            //Inc the step
            steps++;
        }

        //Return the fibonacci number
        return ans;
    }
};
```
