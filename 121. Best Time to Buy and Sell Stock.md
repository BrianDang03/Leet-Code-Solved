Date Solved: 4/5/2024

Language: C++

Difficulty: Easy

# Problem

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

>Example 1:
>
>>Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
>>
>>Output: 5
>>
>>Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
>>
>>Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
>>
>>Output: 0
>>
>>Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 
Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5<sup>
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) {
            return 0; // Edge case: Empty prices vector
        }

        int minPrice = prices[0]; // Initialize the minimum price to the first day's price
        int maxProf = 0; // Initialize maximum profit to 0

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            // Update the minimum price seen so far
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);

            // Update the maximum profit if selling on this day would give a better profit
            maxProf = max(maxProf, prices[i] - minPrice);
        }

        return maxProf;
    }
};

// class Solution {
// public:
//     // Function to calculate the maximum profit from buying and selling a stock once
//     int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) 
//     {
//         int maxProf = 0; // Initialize maximum profit to 0
//         int buy = 0; // Initialize index of the day when the stock was bought

//         // Iterate through the prices vector
//         for (int sell = 0; sell < prices.size(); sell++)
//         {
//             // If the current price is lower than the price at which the stock was bought,
//             // update the buy index to the current day indicating a new potential buying opportunity
//             if (prices[sell] < prices[buy])
//             {
//                 buy = sell;
//             }

//             // Calculate the profit by subtracting the buy price from the sell price,
//             // and update the maximum profit seen so far
//             maxProf = max(maxProf, prices[sell] - prices[buy]);
//         }    

//         // Return the maximum profit obtained
//         return maxProf;
//     }
// };
