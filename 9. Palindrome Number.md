# Problem

Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome, and false otherwise.

>Example 1:
>
>>Input: x = 121
>>
>>Output: true
>>
>>Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

>Example 2:
>
>>Input: x = -121
>>
>>Output: false
>>
>>Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

>Example 3:
>
>>Input: x = 10
>>
>>Output: false
>>
>>Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 
Constraints:

-2<sup>31</sup> <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) 
    {
        //If x is Negative
        if (x < 0) {
            return false;
        }

        // Simple linear solution, just add them to a number and * 10 to the number after
        //Long is to store a very big number 64 bits int
        long compare = 0, xt = x;
        while (xt != 0) {
            //Get the place value
            compare *= 10;

            //Add the the digit to the place value
            compare += xt%10;

            //Go to the next digit from right to left
            xt /= 10;
        }
        return compare == x;
    }
};
```
